<details><summary><h3>üñº Send just the images and style names</h3></summary><p>
    <br>
    <b>If you would like to send images, create a pull request and do the following:</b>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Make sure that all images are named with their respective style name.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Be sure to do one of the following:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Put the images in the correct places within the "Images" folder. If doing this, make sure to put the images in a new folder that way it is easier for me to find them.</li>
                <li>-or-</li>
                <li>Put all of the images in the "Images" folder.</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Make sure you mention the exact prompt format(s) that you used. You can write these in the "conversations" of the pull request.</li>
            <ul>
            <li>For example: if one of your prompts was "sphere, golden --seed 4776" then you would say you used "sphere, &#60;style&#62; --seed 4776"</li>
            <li>This does not need to be done for each individual image. Just each prompt format that you used.</li>
            </ul>
    </ol>
    <br>
    After the pull request is approved, I will take care of adding them to the markdown files and crediting you.
